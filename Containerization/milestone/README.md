## Problem Statement: Dockerizing and Deploying a Node.js Application with CICD Pipeline

You have to containerize a Node.js application using Docker, configuring environment variables within the Docker containers, defining a Docker Compose file for multiple services (including a database service), and setting up a Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) pipeline to deploy the Dockerized application on a server. 

Follow the detailed instructions below:

1. **Dockerize the Application:**
   - Containerize the existing Node.js application using Docker. Create a Dockerfile that specifies the necessary steps to package the application into a Docker image.
   - Ensure that the Dockerfile includes all dependencies, configurations, and commands required to run the application within a Docker container.

2. **Configure Environment Variables in Docker:**
   - Properly configure environment variables within the Docker container for the Node.js application.
   - Document the purpose of each environment variable and its expected values.
   - Implement secure practices for managing sensitive information in the Docker environment.

3. **Define Docker Compose for Multiple Services:**
   - Develop a Docker Compose file that defines multiple services, including the Dockerized Node.js application and a separate service for a database (e.g., MongoDB or MySQL).
   - Configure communication between the application and the database service within the Docker Compose file.
   - Specify any necessary environment variables for the database service.

4. **Setup CICD Pipeline:**
   - Implement a CICD pipeline using a chosen tool (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI/CD) to automate the deployment of the Dockerized application.
   - Define pipeline stages for code validation, Docker image building, and deployment to a server.
   - Integrate proper error handling and reporting within the CICD pipeline.
   - Document the pipeline configuration, highlighting key steps and decisions made during the setup.

### Submission Guidelines:
- Provide a well-documented Dockerfile detailing the steps taken to containerize the Node.js application.
- Provide documentation for environment variable configurations within the Docker container.
- Include the Docker Compose file specifying services for both the Node.js application and the database.
- Demonstrate the CICD pipeline setup, including the chosen tool, pipeline stages, and error handling mechanisms.
