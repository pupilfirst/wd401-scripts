## Submission requirements

Please record a video using visual aids as needed to satisfy the requirements covered in last two lessons.

- Make sure that the video you submit is clear with good audio. Check that your environment is well-lit and quiet to ensure good video and audio quality.
- Use your code/application/presentation or any other creative ways to demo your work so far.
- Watch your video back to ensure everything looks and sounds good. Make any necessary adjustments before finalising your submission.
- If you're submitting a Google drive URL, set the access permission as "Anyone can view" atleast. You can upload your video to any platform and share that URL as well.

We are looking forward to seeing your video and the work :-).
