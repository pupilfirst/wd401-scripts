In this lesson, we will learn about testing and why testing is so important in software development. Software testing verfies that the software does what it intends to do.

### Resource 1

### Resource 3

- [Test Driven Development](https://developer.ibm.com/articles/5-steps-of-test-driven-development/)

Test driven development is the practise of only writing a failing test case at first, then writing minimum code to make the test pass. This might sound counter productive at first, but doing so helps in thinking through the design of the program and helps move faster over the time.
