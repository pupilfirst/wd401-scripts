In this lesson, you will learn more about the different environments that a project can be in, as it goes through the process of development and eventually being released. So let's get started.

### What Are Environments?
Environments are digital spaces where the development, testing and publishing of a website or web app is taking place. Itâ€™s a collection of resources that host a website or web app.

Generally, app environments can be divided into three main categories, with each their own unique purpose and functionalities: the **development environment**, the **staging or testing environment** and the **production environment**.

1. **Development Environment:** A local development environment is where programmers initially build the features of an application. In a local development environment, a programmer can work on their feature without worrying about, or potentially breaking, what other developers may be working on.
2. **Staging Environment:** The staging environment is an environment that attempts to match production as closely as possible in terms of resources used  including computational load, hardware, and architecture. This means that when an application is in staging, it should be able to handle the amount of work it is expected to be doing in production.
3. **Production Environment:** When the development team, product owners, and end-users have thoroughly tested the product in the staging environment, the app is pushed to the production environment. The production environment contains live data and it is accessible to it's end-users.

Now, let me show you how we've documented, how to run a Node.Js application in production environment.

> Action: Open and show the RUN-APP-IN-PROD.md file.

So, that's it for this lesson, see you in the next one.
