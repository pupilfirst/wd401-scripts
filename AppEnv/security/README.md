In this lesson, you will focus on application seciruty, and what measures need to be taken in each app environemnt. So, let's get started.

In today's digital landscape, security is paramount for any application or system. As part of application deployment process, it is important to build in robust and thorough security measures for your systems and applications before they are publicly available.

### Identifying Security Considerations
If you are deploying your application in production environment, you've to identify the following security considerations:

- **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong user authentication and authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel can access sensitive systems and data.

- **SSL Certificates:** Secure your web applications and services with SSL/TLS certificates to encrypt data in transit. Use trusted certificate authorities for certificate issuance.

- **Access Controls:** Implement strict access controls and least privilege principles. Employees should only have access to the resources necessary for their roles.

### Implementing Security Measures

#### 1. SSL Certificates
SSL certificates, also known as TLS certificates, encrypt data exchanged between a user's browser and your server, ensuring data integrity and privacy. To implement SSL certificates:

- Choose a reputable Certificate Authority (CA) to purchase or obtain a free SSL certificate.
- Install and configure the SSL certificate on your web server.
- Use HTTPS to secure web traffic, and enforce secure communication throughout your application.
  
#### 2. Access Controls
Access control is crucial for safeguarding sensitive data and functionalities. Implement these access control measures:

- Utilize role-based access control (RBAC) to assign permissions to users and ensure the principle of least privilege.
- Implement strong authentication methods, such as OAuth2, JWT, or SSO.
- Regularly review and update access control policies as your application evolves.
1. Monitoring and Incident Response
