## Problem Statement: Deploying and Securing a Node.js Application in Cluster Mode with PM2
You've a Node.js application, now you have to deploy the application in cluster mode using PM2, a process manager for Node.js applications. Additionally, you need to implement environment variable configurations for both development and production environments, and implement security measures to safeguard the application. Follow the instructions below:

1. **Environment Variable Configuration:**

- Set up environment variables for your Node.js application to accommodate both development and production environments.
- Clearly document the purpose of each environment variable and its expected values.
- Ensure sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, is appropriately managed using environment variables.

2. **PM2 Cluster Mode Deployment:**

- Utilize PM2 to deploy your Node.js application in cluster mode.
- Document the configuration parameters used for PM2 deployment.
- Make sure the application logs gets saved properly.

3. **Security Measures:**
Implement security measures to fortify your Node.js application:
- Apply best practices for securing environment variables, ensuring they are not exposed unintentionally.
- Employ HTTPS to encrypt data in transit, utilizing a valid SSL certificate (optional).

### Submission Guidelines:

- Provide a detailed documentation file that includes the list and purpose of environment variables for both development and production environments.
- Include the PM2 configuration settings for deploying the application in cluster mode.
Demonstrate the security measures implemented, explaining the rationale behind each measure.
