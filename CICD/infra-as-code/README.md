In this lesson we will learn about an intresting topic called *Infrastructure as Code* Or **IaC**. 
It is nothing but a practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure resources (e.g., servers, networks, databases) using code and automation, rather than manual processes.

Now you might ask, we already have our CICD workflow, why the hell we need something like this? Let's find out.

### Why IaC?
- **Scalability:** IaC allows for the efficient scaling of infrastructure resources up or down based on demand.
- **Consistency:** It ensures consistent and reproducible environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Version Control:** Infrastructure changes can be tracked and versioned like software code.
- **Error Reduction:** Manual errors are minimized, leading to increased reliability.

### Now, let's find out the popular available to implement IaC:
There are several tools and languages commonly used for implementing IaC:
- **Terraform:** Terraform is an open-source, declarative IaC tool developed by HashiCorp. It allows you to define and provision infrastructure resources using a domain-specific language called HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) or JSON.
- **Ansible:** Ansible is an agentless automation tool that can also be used for IaC. It uses simple YAML-based playbooks to describe automation tasks, including infrastructure provisioning.

I know these topics are a bit advance, and it will take quite some time for you to figure out how to inplement them for your application. So, if you want to learn more about these tools and languages, you can go through the following resources to get a detailed step by step implementation guide.
