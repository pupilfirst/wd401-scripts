## Problem Statement: Implementing a fully functional CI-CD pipeline for your web application
You've a web application (could be a Node.Js or a React.Js app). Now you have to setup a CICD pipeline for it. The primary goal is to automate the deployment process, ensuring seamless integration of code changes and swift error detection. Follow the instructions below:

1. **GitHub Actions Pipeline:**

- Utilize GitHub Actions as the CICD tool to create the pipeline for your web application.
- Implement a pipeline that includes stages for code validation, build, testing, and deployment. The pipeline should trigger automatically upon code changes.

2. **Automated Test Cases:**

- Integrate an automated testing step into your pipeline to validate the functionality, performance, and integrity of the application.
- Define and implement test cases that cover critical aspects of the application's features. These tests should be automatically executed during the pipeline, providing an additional layer of validation before deployment.

3. **Environment Variable Configuration:**

- Adequately configure environment variables within the CICD pipeline. These variables should encompass any sensitive or environment-specific information required for the application to function correctly across various stages.

4. **Error Reporting Integration:**

- Integrate error reporting mechanisms into your pipeline.
- In case of any errors during the pipeline execution, immediately notify the development team by posting detailed error messages and logs to a designated Slack or Discord channel.
- Ensure that the error notification includes relevant information for quick diagnosis and resolution.


### Submission Guidelines:

- Create a well-documented YAML file for the GitHub Actions pipeline, clearly delineating each stage's purpose and execution.
- Document the purpose and usage of each environment variable, ensuring clarity for future maintenance.
- Demonstrate the error reporting integration in action, emphasizing how error messages are promptly communicated to the designated Slack or Discord channel.
- Verify that the pipeline successfully triggers on code changes, executes the test cases, and deploys the application without manual intervention.
