In modern web development, ensuring that your JavaScript code is compatible with various browsers and environments is crucial. Babel is a versatile tool that allows you to transpile modern JavaScript features into an older version that's widely supported. In this lesson, we'll explore how to configure Babel to support modern JavaScript features in older environments and gain an understanding of different Babel presets and plugins.

**The Role of Babel in JavaScript Development:**

Babel plays a vital role in web development by allowing developers to write code using the latest ECMAScript features while ensuring compatibility with older browsers and environments.

**Configuring Babel:**

To begin, let's explore how to configure Babel:

- **Babel Presets:** Babel presets are pre-configured sets of plugins that target specific JavaScript environments. We'll look at popular presets like `@babel/preset-env` for targeting different browser versions.

- **Custom Configuration:** You can also create custom configurations by selecting individual plugins to meet your project's requirements.

**Understanding Babel Plugins:**

Babel plugins are responsible for transforming specific JavaScript features. We'll explore different Babel plugins, such as:

- **Syntax Plugins:** These plugins enable Babel to understand and transform new syntax features.

- **Transform Plugins:** Transform plugins convert modern JavaScript features into older versions.
