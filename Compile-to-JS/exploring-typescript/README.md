## Script

TypeScript is a powerful Compile to JavaScript language that introduces a type system and static typing advantages to your JavaScript code. In this lesson, we'll delve into TypeScript's type system, discover the advantages of static typing, and learn how to annotate variables, functions, and interfaces with TypeScript types.

**Understanding TypeScript's Type System:**

TypeScript's type system is at the heart of its capabilities. It allows developers to specify the data types of variables, function parameters, and return values, enhancing code quality and tooling support.

**Advantages of Static Typing:**

Static typing offers several benefits:

- **Early Error Detection:** TypeScript can catch potential errors during development, reducing the risk of runtime issues.

- **Code Quality:** Strong typing helps ensure that data is used consistently, resulting in more robust code.

- **Improved Tooling:** Editors and IDEs can provide better code completion, refactoring, and error checking with type information.

**Annotating Variables with TypeScript Types:**

Let's start by exploring how to annotate variables with TypeScript types:

- **Basic Types:** You can specify types like `number`, `string`, `boolean`, and more.

- **Custom Types:** TypeScript allows you to create custom types using `type` and `interface` declarations.

**Annotating Functions with TypeScript Types:**

Next, let's learn how to annotate functions:

- **Function Parameters:** You can specify the types of function parameters, improving clarity and error checking.

- **Return Types:** Define the expected return type of a function, making it clear what the function should produce.

**Annotating Interfaces with TypeScript:**

Interfaces define the structure of objects. You can create clear and reusable data shapes by annotating interfaces with TypeScript types.

TypeScript's type system and static typing advantages provide developers with a robust toolset for building scalable and maintainable JavaScript applications. By understanding and applying TypeScript types effectively, you can enhance your coding experience and produce more reliable code.
