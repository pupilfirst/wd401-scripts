In this lesson, we will learn about internationalisation or i18n and localisation or l10n.

Internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) are two important concepts in software development and content management, particularly when creating applications or content that need to be accessible to a global audience.

### Internationalization (i18n)

Internationalization is the process of designing and developing software in a way that makes it adaptable to different languages, regions, and cultures without major code or content changes. The term "i18n" is used because there are 18 letters between 'i' and 'n' in the word "internationalization."

The key aspects of internationalization include:

- **Language-agnostic design**:
  Creating a software application or content with an architecture and design that doesn't assume a specific language or locale.
- **Unicode support**:
  Using Unicode character encoding to handle diverse characters and scripts from various languages.
- **Externalizing content**:
  Storing text, labels, and other content separately from the code, typically in resource files or databases, to make translation easier.
- **Date, time, and number formatting**:
  Ensuring that date and time formats, as well as numeric representations, are customizable according to different regions and cultures.

### Localization (l10n)

Localization refers to the process of adapting software to a specific locale, language, or region to meet the cultural, linguistic, and functional expectations of users in that area. The term "l10n" is used because there are 10 letters between 'l' and 'n' in the word "localization."

Key elements of localization include:

- **Translation**:
  Converting all the text and content elements of the application from the source language to the target language(s).
- **Cultural adaptation**:
  Adjusting images, icons, colors, and other design elements to be culturally appropriate and relevant.
- **Formatting**:
  Adapting date and time formats, currency symbols, and numeric conventions to match the expectations of the target locale.
- **Legal and regulatory compliance**:
  Ensuring that the software complies with local laws and regulations, such as privacy policies and data protection rules.
