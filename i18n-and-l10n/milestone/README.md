To complete this level, you are required to implement internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) features in a React.js application. The goal is to make the application accessible and user-friendly for a global audience by enabling the dynamic translation of content, localizing date and time formats, and providing the ability to switch between different locales.

- Dynamic Content Translation:

  - Implement a system for translating dynamic content within the React.js application. This involves creating language files or dictionaries that store translations for different languages.
  - Integrate a mechanism to dynamically switch between languages based on user preferences or system settings.
    Apply translation to various components, text elements, and messages throughout the application to ensure a seamless multilingual user experience.

- Date and Time Localization:

  - Localize date and time formats to accommodate different cultural preferences. Consider the variations in date formats (e.g., MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY) and time formats (12-hour vs. 24-hour clock).
  - Utilize libraries or functions that handle date and time localization, ensuring that timestamps are presented in a format consistent with the user's locale.

- Locale Switching:

  - Implement a user interface (UI) component or a settings panel that allows users to select their preferred language/locale.
  - Enable the application to respond dynamically to locale changes, updating content and formatting according to the selected locale.
  - Ensure that the locale switch is persistent across sessions, providing a smooth and personalized experience for users who want to interact with the application in their preferred language.
