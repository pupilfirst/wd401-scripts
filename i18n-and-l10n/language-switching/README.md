Locale negotiation in web browsers is the process by which a browser determines the user's preferred language and regional settings. These are essential for rendering web content in the user's preferred language. This is crucial for providing a localized and personalized user experience.

The preferences can be found out using following ways:

- #### User's Language Preferences:

  When a user first installs or configures a web browser, they typically set their preferred languages and regions in the browser's settings. This information is provided by the user and stored as part of the browser's configuration.

- #### HTTP Accept-Language Header:

  When a user visits a website, their browser sends an HTTP header called "Accept-Language" as part of the request to the web server. This header contains a list of the user's preferred languages and regions in order of preference. For example, it might look like this:

  ```md
  Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.8,fr;q=0.6
  ```

  The `q-values` indicate the relative preference for each language.

- #### Server-Side Language Negotiation:

  When the web server receives the request, it can examine the `Accept-Language` header to determine the user's preferred languages. The server can use this information to select the appropriate version of the web content to serve to the user.

- #### Fallbacks and Default Language:

  In cases where the web server doesn't have content in the user's preferred language or region, it can fall back to the user's next preferred language, or it can serve content in a default or primary language.

- #### JavaScript and Client-Side Localization:

  In addition to server-side language negotiation, modern web applications often use client-side JavaScript to further customize the user experience. JavaScript can detect the user's language settings and dynamically load or change content, interface elements, and messages accordingly.

### Implementing language detection in React

We can use the package `i18next-browser-languagedetector` with `react-i18next` to figure out user's preferred language settings.
