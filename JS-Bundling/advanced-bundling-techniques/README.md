In this lesson, we'll delve into advanced bundling techniques using Webpack. We'll explore how to configure Webpack for code splitting, lazy loading, and tree shaking to ensure optimized loading of JS assets.

**Optimizing JS Loading:**

Efficient JavaScript loading is essential for improving page load times and overall user experience. By splitting and loading JavaScript code only when needed, we can reduce initial load times and save bandwidth.

**Code Splitting and Lazy Loading:**

Webpack provides robust support for code splitting and lazy loading. Let's explore these techniques:

- **Code Splitting:** Code splitting involves breaking down your application's JavaScript code into smaller, more manageable chunks. These chunks can be loaded on-demand, reducing the initial load time of your application.

- **Lazy Loading:** Lazy loading is a strategy where you load JavaScript modules only when they are required, typically triggered by user interactions. This helps keep the initial load of your application minimal.

**Configuring Webpack for Code Splitting:**

We'll configure Webpack to implement code splitting and lazy loading:

- **Entry Points:** Define multiple entry points for your application, specifying which parts of your code should be included in different bundles.

- **Dynamic Imports:** Utilize dynamic imports to specify which modules should be loaded lazily, based on user actions or route changes.

**Tree Shaking:**

Tree shaking is a technique to eliminate unused code from your final bundle. It helps reduce the bundle size and optimize performance.

- **ES6 Modules:** Tree shaking works best with ES6 module syntax. It relies on static analysis to determine which code is unused and can be safely removed.

- **Configuration:** Configure Webpack to enable tree shaking by using the `mode` option, setting it to 'production' to enable optimization.
