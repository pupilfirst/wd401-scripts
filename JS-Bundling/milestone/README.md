# Scenario: Optimizing JS Integration in Your First Web Development Task

Congratulations on starting your journey as a Web Developer! You've joined a team where the integration and bundling of JavaScript (JS) is a crucial aspect of their modern web development stack. Let's explore a work-specific scenario based on the lessons you've covered in JS bundling.

## Scenario:
You're assigned to a project that involves enhancing the user interface of an existing web application. Your task is to integrate JS seamlessly to improve the user experience. The team encourages the use of JS bundling tools like Webpack and is particularly interested in optimizing the bundling process.

## Problem Statement:
In your new role as a Web Developer, you're assigned to a project that involves optimizing the integration of JavaScript into a web application. The team emphasizes the importance of efficient JS bundling for enhanced application performance. As you embark on the development task, challenges related to bundling, code splitting, lazy loading, and the implementation of import maps surface. Your role is to address these challenges, showcasing your ability to optimize JS integration and explore advanced bundling techniques. The team is particularly interested in your practical application of concepts such as code splitting, lazy loading, and import maps to improve the application's overall performance.

## Your Task:
In a detailed response, address the following aspects:

### Configuring Webpack:

Share your Webpack configuration setup to handle various file types and assets. Provide code snippets to showcase how you've customized the configuration to handle CSS and images efficiently.

### Advanced Bundling Techniques:

Illustrate how you've implemented code splitting and lazy loading in a sample project. Discuss the benefits of these techniques and how they contribute to optimized loading of JS assets.

### Introduction to Import Maps:

Explain the concept of import maps and their advantages over traditional bundling approaches. Provide insights into the scenarios where import maps offer unique benefits.

### Implementing Import Maps:

Detail the integration of import maps into real-world projects. Discuss any compatibility issues or limitations encountered across different browsers. Provide code snippets demonstrating the refactor of an existing project to use import maps for JS modules.

> Note: This task is designed to assess your practical application of JS bundling concepts in a real-world development scenario. Use code snippets and examples to demonstrate your understanding and problem-solving skills.
