## Text

Post-mortem analysis is a process conducted after the occurrence of an incident or event to evaluate what happened, why it happened, and how similar incidents can be prevented in the future.

The primary goals of a post-mortem analysis include:

- Understanding the Incident:

  Identify and document the details of the incident, including the timeline of events, actions taken, and their outcomes.

- Identifying Root Causes:

  Determine the underlying causes and contributing factors that led to the incident. This involves going beyond the immediate symptoms to understand the deeper issues.

- Learning Lessons:

  Extract lessons learned from the incident, including both positive aspects (what went well) and areas for improvement (what could be done better).

- Implementing Corrective Actions:

  Develop and implement specific corrective actions to address the root causes and prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.

- Improving Processes:

  Use the insights gained from the analysis to make improvements to processes, procedures, and systems to enhance overall resilience and performance.
