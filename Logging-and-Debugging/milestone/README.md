This milestone requires integration of error tracking and debugging features into a React.js application to enhance the application's stability, identify and resolve issues efficiently. The key features to implement are:

- Error Tracking System:

  - Integrate a robust error tracking system that captures and logs errors occurring within the React.js application. Consider using third-party tools or libraries that specialize in error tracking, such as Sentry or Rollbar.
  - Ensure that the error tracking system collects relevant information about the errors, including stack traces, error messages, and contextual data such as user actions leading to the error.
  - Configure alerts or notifications to inform developers promptly when critical errors occur, allowing for quick response and resolution.

- Debugger Capability:

  - Implement debugging capabilities to facilitate the identification and resolution of issues during development and testing.
  - Leverage tools like React DevTools or other browser developer tools to inspect component hierarchies, examine state and props, and debug application logic.
  - Enable breakpoints, stepping through code, and inspecting variable values to streamline the debugging process and empower developers to isolate and fix issues efficiently.
