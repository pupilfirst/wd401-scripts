In production environment, it is essential to set up error tracking and alerts for critical issues. Error tracking is the proactive process of monitoring web applications or microservices to identify problems and fix them before they become serious issues. Usually, error tracking tools will monitor your applications for any deviation from benchmark activity levels.

According to Sentry:

> Before you can fix an error, you need to find it. And if finding errors is like looking for a needle in a code haystack, then Sentry's error monitoring is a metal detector. With it, you can now diagnose, fix, and optimize your code to meet the demands of your customers.
