# Explore the addition of GenAI to your web app

This milestone is exploratory in nature. Generative AI, being an emerging field, may not be universally applicable across all web applications. However, its potential to revolutionize user experiences through automation, personalization, and enhanced creativity is undeniable.

In this milestone assignment, you're encouraged to investigate how Generative AI might enhance your web application, focusing on user experience and feature improvements.

Let's divide this assignment into three stages:

- **Potential Applications**

  - Use your familiarity with your web application to determine where the addition of AI could have a positive impact. If you identify possible applications for AI in enhancing your web app, describe how you envision its integration and the specific benefits you aim to achieve. This could include, but is not limited to, personalized user experiences, content generation, or streamlined interactions.

- **Challenges and Decisions**

  - If you decide to experiment with integrating Generative AI features, report on any technical, practical, or conceptual challenges you faced. How did these challenges influence your decision on whether to proceed with integration?

- **Critical Evaluation**

  - Conclude by critically evaluating whether Generative AI suits your web application. Consider the technology's impact on user experience, operational feasibility, and long-term sustainability.
