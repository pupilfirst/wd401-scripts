# Scenario: Navigating Pull-Request Challenges in Your First Development Task

Congratulations on landing your first job as a Software Developer! You've joined a dynamic team where collaborative development is key, and the workflow heavily relies on pull-requests. Let's delve into a work-specific scenario based on the lessons we have covered.

## Scenario:
You're assigned to a project that involves implementing a critical feature using a branching strategy inspired by GitFlow. Each developer creates feature branches, works on their assigned tasks, and then submits pull-requests for code review.

> Note: This task is designed to assess your practical application of pull-request concepts in a real-world development setting. Feel free to use pseudocode or actual code snippets to demonstrate your problem-solving skills.

## Problem Statement:
You've been assigned to a project that involves enhancing a critical feature for a web application. The team places a strong emphasis on the pull-request workflow, with a focus on code reviews, merge conflict resolution, and the recent integration of CI/CD. As you navigate through the development task, you encounter challenges such as feedback during code reviews and discussions on effective merge conflict resolution. The team looks to you to demonstrate your understanding of these challenges and your ability to adapt to the added complexity of CI/CD integration.

> Note: Please use the below code sample for the solution if you do not have any relevant real-world project examples to share.

```js
const handleSubmit = async (event: React.FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) => {
  event.preventDefault();

  try {
    const response = await fetch(`${API_ENDPOINT}/organisations`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ name: organisationName, user_name: userName, email: userEmail, password: userPassword }),
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Sign-up failed with status ${response.status}`);
    }
    console.log('Sign-up successful');

    const data = await response.json();
    localStorage.setItem('authToken', data.token);
    localStorage.setItem('userData', JSON.stringify(data.user));
    navigate("/dashboard");
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Sign-up failed:', error);
  }
};
```

## Your Task:
In a detailed response, address the following aspects:

### Handling Code Review Feedback:

Provide actual code snippets or pseudocode illustrating feedback received during code reviews. Explain how you plan to address the feedback and improve the code.

> Note: Add the Feedback as a comment on each line you are providing feedback for, in the solution. Also, provide the updated code based on your code review feedback as a final solution separately.

### Iterative Development Process:

Create a flowchart or diagram depicting how you will approach iterative development to refine your feature based on feedback.

### Resolving Merge Conflicts:

Share real or hypothetical code snippets with potential merge conflicts. Provide a step-by-step guide, including commands if applicable, on how you would resolve these conflicts within a pull-request.

### CI/CD Integration:

Include portions of your code and explain how you've ensured it aligns with CI/CD requirements. Illustrate code snippets related to automated tests and quality checks. If there are potential issues, describe how you would troubleshoot and address them.
