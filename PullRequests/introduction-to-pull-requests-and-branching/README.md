Welcome to an Introduction to Pull-Requests and Branching.

In software engineering, collaboration is key. Imagine you're working on a project with a team of developers. How do you manage changes without stepping on each other's toes?

This is where pull-requests come in. A pull-request is a way to propose changes to a codebase, specifically when using version control systems like Git. It allows team members to review and discuss the proposed changes before merging them.

Let's break down a pull-request. First, you create a new branch for your feature or bug fix. This keeps your changes isolated from the main codebase. Once your changes are ready, you initiate a pull-request.

Think of a pull-request as a request to 'pull' your changes from your branch into the main branch. This gives others a chance to review and test your code before it becomes part of the project.

There are different strategies for branching. One popular approach is GitFlow, which uses branches like 'feature,' 'develop,' 'release,' and 'hotfix.' This structure helps organize development and releases.

Another common approach is feature branching. Each new feature gets its own branch. This keeps the codebase clean and allows for parallel development.

Pull-requests offer several benefits. They encourage collaboration, as team members can discuss changes and provide feedback. This process enhances code quality and reduces errors.

Now, let's dive into a practical demonstration. We'll walk through creating a branch, making changes, and creating a pull-request.

To sum up, pull-requests are a vital part of collaborative software development. They promote teamwork, code review, and overall project stability.

In the next lesson, we'll explore branching strategies in-depth and provide hands-on examples. Stay tuned!
