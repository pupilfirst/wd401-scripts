Welcome to the lesson where we will learn about automating your Pull-Requests and improving development timelines. 

In modern software, automation is a game-changer, and in this lesson, we'll explore how to integrate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with pull-requests. We'll delve into setting up automated tests and code quality checks, streamlining your development workflow.

Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) are practices that automate the process of integrating code changes, running tests, and deploying to production. Integrating CI/CD with pull-requests ensures that each code change is thoroughly tested before being merged.

**Setting Up Automated Tests:**

Test Suites: Create automated test suites that cover various aspects of your codebase, from unit tests to integration tests.

Pre-Merge Testing: Configure your CI/CD system to run the test suites automatically when a pull request is created. This ensures that proposed changes meet quality standards.

**Code Quality Checks:**

Static Analysis: Utilize static code analysis tools to identify code smells, potential bugs, and violations of coding standards.

Linter Integration: Integrate linters into your CI/CD process to catch issues related to code formatting and style.

**Hands-on Practice:**

Let's jump into a hands-on demonstration. We'll guide you through the process of setting up a CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests and checks code quality when a pull request is submitted.

> Action: Setup a basic CICD with quality and linter checks on the WD201 repo.

Integrating CI/CD practices with pull-requests enhances code quality, streamlines development, and minimizes the risk of introducing bugs into the codebase. By automating tests and quality checks, you're ensuring that every code change is thoroughly examined before reaching production.

See you in the next one!
