Welcome to the lesson where we will learn more about handling Merge Conflicts.

While working on a collaborative development setup, merge conflicts are a reality we all face. In this lesson, we'll dive into understanding merge conflicts, exploring strategies to resolve them, and gaining hands-on experience in resolving merge conflicts within pull requests.

**Understanding Merge Conflicts:**

Merge conflicts occur when there are conflicting changes in different branches, making it impossible for the system to automatically determine which version to accept. This often arises when two or more developers modify the same file or code segment simultaneously.

**Strategies to Resolve Merge Conflicts:**

- Manual Inspection: Start by carefully reviewing the conflicting changes to understand the context and the source of conflict.

- Resolving Line by Line: Address conflicts by manually selecting and editing the conflicting lines to create a unified, cohesive version.

- Accepting or Discarding Changes: Choose which version of the conflicting changes to keep, and which to discard, ensuring the integrity of the codebase.

- Testing: After resolving conflicts, thoroughly test the merged code to ensure that it functions as expected and doesn't introduce new issues.

**Hands-on Practice:**

Now, let's jump into a hands-on demonstration. We'll walk through an example of a pull request with conflicting changes. You'll see the step-by-step process of identifying, resolving, and validating merge conflicts.

> Action: Open WD201 repo and resolve a Merge conflict already created.

Merge conflicts are an inevitable part of collaborative coding. By understanding the causes of conflicts and mastering conflict resolution strategies, you equip yourself with skills to maintain a seamless and productive development process.

In the next lesson, we'll explore advanced techniques to automate the Pull request process focusing on faster resolutions.
